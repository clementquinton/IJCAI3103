This repository contains two folders.

- The *seq* folder contains the material required to launch the experiment on a single machine.
- The *dis* folder contains the material to distribute jobs on a cluster of machines.

To run the experiment, move the *in* folder into either *seq* or *dis*.

The results presented in the [results](../results) folder have been generated using the distributed run.
